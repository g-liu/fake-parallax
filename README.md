Fake Parallax
=============

Most parallax scrolling solutions today use JavaScript or a JS library. Not this one. It's pure HTML and CSS, and not a single line of code is needed to 

## Explanation

The `body` element contains a fixed background image. It does not scroll with the rest of the elements, which have an opaque background.

Yes, the image in the back does not move. This is why it's called **fake** parallax. It still achieves a nice effect without any JavaScript.
